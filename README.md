# GPT Language Model from Scratch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a **GPT-like language model** trained from scratch. The model is designed to generate text character by character, learning patterns from a given dataset. The code is structured to be educational, providing a clear understanding of how transformer-based models work, including self-attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, and multi-head attention.

---

## **Overview**

The project is divided into several components:

1. **Text Encoding and Decoding**:
   - A `TextEncoderDecoder` class is used to handle character-level tokenization and detokenization.
   - The dataset is encoded into integer tensors for training.

2. **Dataset Loading**:
   - The `load_dataset` function retrieves a text dataset from a URL (e.g., the Tiny Shakespeare dataset) and splits it into training and validation sets.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - The `GPTLanguageModel` class implements a transformer-based language model with:
     - Token and positional embeddings.
     - Multi-head self-attention.
     - Feedforward layers.
     - Layer normalization and dropout for regularization.

4. **Training Loop**:
   - The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with weight decay.
   - Loss is evaluated on both training and validation sets at regular intervals.

5. **Text Generation**:
   - After training, the model can generate text by sampling from the predicted probability distribution.

## **Key Features**

- **Character-Level Modeling**:
  - The model operates at the character level, making it suitable for small-scale text generation tasks.

- **Transformer Architecture**:
  - The model uses multi-head self-attention and positional embeddings to capture long-range dependencies in the text.

- **Regularization**:
  - Dropout and weight decay are used to prevent overfitting.

- **Educational Focus**:
  - The code is designed to be easy to understand, with comments explaining key concepts such as attention mechanisms and layer normalization.

## **Code Structure**

### **1. Text Encoding and Decoding**
- `TextEncoderDecoder`: Handles character-to-integer and integer-to-character mappings.
- `load_dataset`: Downloads and processes the dataset, splitting it into training and validation sets.

### **2. Model Architecture**
- `GPTLanguageModel`: The main transformer-based language model.
  - Token and positional embeddings.
  - Multi-head self-attention (`MultiHeadAttention` and `Head` classes).
  - Feedforward layers (`FeedFoward` class).
  - Layer normalization and dropout.

### **3. Training and Evaluation**
- `get_batch`: Generates batches of input-target pairs for training.
- `estimate_loss`: Evaluates the model's performance on training and validation sets.
- Training loop: Trains the model using the Adam optimizer.

### **4. Text Generation**
- `generate`: Generates text by sampling from the model's predictions.
